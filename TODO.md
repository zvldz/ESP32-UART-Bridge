# TODO / Roadmap

## ACTIVE TASKS 🔄

### REGRESSION TESTING - After SBUS Phase 11 🔴 CRITICAL

**Priority**: Verify that unified sender architecture (Phase 11) didn't break existing functionality

- [ ] **Basic UART Bridge Testing**
  - [ ] Test Device 1 UART → USB bridge with different baud rates
  - [ ] Verify data integrity (bidirectional transfer)
  - [ ] Test flow control (RTS/CTS) if available
  - [ ] Confirm LED indicators work for data activity

- [ ] **Protocol Optimization Testing**
  - [ ] **MAVLink Mode**: Verify zero-latency forwarding still works
    - [ ] Test with Mission Planner or QGroundControl
    - [ ] Verify multi-GCS routing (if configured)
    - [ ] Check priority-based transmission
  - [ ] **RAW Mode**: Verify timing-based buffering works
    - [ ] Test with GPS/NMEA devices
    - [ ] Test with AT command modems
    - [ ] Verify adaptive buffer sizing

- [ ] **Device Roles Testing**
  - [ ] **Device 2**: Test UART2, USB, SBUS modes
  - [ ] **Device 3**: Test Mirror, Bridge, Logger modes
  - [ ] **Device 4**: Test Network Bridge, Network Logger modes

- [ ] **USB Modes** (if hardware available)
  - [ ] Test USB Device mode (ESP32 as COM port)
  - [ ] Test USB Host mode (USB devices connected to ESP32)

**Note**: This is critical - unified sender refactoring touched core data flow. Must verify no regressions before considering Phase 11 complete.

### PLATFORM SUPPORT - Before Final Cleanup 🟠

#### ESP32-S3 Super Mini Support 🟡 PARTIALLY TESTED

- [x] **Hardware Adaptation**
  - [x] Pin mapping for S3 Super Mini board
  - [x] Adjust for different GPIO availability
  - [x] LED functionality verified (GPIO48 WS2815)
  - [ ] Verify USB-CDC functionality

- [x] **Build Configuration**
  - [x] Add platformio environment for S3 Super Mini
  - [x] Conditional compilation with board flags
  - [x] Web interface board type detection

- [ ] **Testing on S3 Super Mini** 🟡 BASIC TESTING COMPLETED
  - [x] Basic ESP32 operation verified
  - [x] WiFi and web interface working
  - [x] LED control functional
  - [x] UDP logging operational
  - [ ] Verify all UART interfaces work (Device 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Test SBUS with hardware inverter (critical for RC)
  - [ ] Check power consumption
  - [ ] Full protocol testing (MAVLink, SBUS, etc.)

**Status**: Super Mini support implemented but not fully tested. Basic functionality (WiFi, web, LEDs, UDP logs) confirmed working. UART and SBUS functionality requires hardware testing with actual devices.

#### XIAO ESP32-S3 Support 🟡 PLANNED

- [ ] **Hardware Adaptation**
  - [ ] Pin mapping for XIAO ESP32-S3 board
  - [ ] Adjust for different GPIO availability
  - [ ] LED functionality (single color LED, blink-only mode)
  - [ ] External antenna support configuration
  - [ ] Verify USB-CDC functionality
  - [ ] Consider compact form factor constraints

- [ ] **Build Configuration**
  - [ ] Add platformio environment for XIAO ESP32-S3
  - [ ] Conditional compilation with board flags
  - [ ] Web interface board type detection
  - [ ] SDK configuration for XIAO variant

- [ ] **Testing on XIAO ESP32-S3**
  - [ ] Basic ESP32 operation verification
  - [ ] WiFi and web interface functionality
  - [ ] LED control (blink patterns only, no RGB)
  - [ ] External antenna range/stability testing
  - [ ] UDP logging operational
  - [ ] Verify all UART interfaces work (Device 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Test SBUS with hardware inverter
  - [ ] Test SBUS over WiFi/UDP with external antenna
  - [ ] Check power consumption (important for small board)
  - [ ] Full protocol testing (MAVLink, SBUS, etc.)
  - [ ] Thermal testing (compact board heat dissipation)

**Note**: XIAO ESP32-S3 is even more compact than Super Mini. Has external antenna connector which is beneficial for network operations like SBUS over UDP/WiFi, improving range and reliability. This is important as boards like Zero with PCB antennas can have unstable ping times causing SBUS packet loss when timing requirements (14ms frame rate) are not met. External antenna should provide more stable connection for time-critical protocols. Need to verify pin availability and power/thermal characteristics for reliable operation.
