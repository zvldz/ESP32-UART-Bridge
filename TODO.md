# TODO / Roadmap

## ACTIVE TASKS 🔄

### FUTURE PROTOCOLS & FEATURES 🔵

#### Web Interface Improvements

- [ ] **Show connected clients info in AP mode**
  - Number of connected stations
  - List of client IP addresses
  - IP of current web interface user

- [x] **Terminal protocol optimization** (v2.19.0)
  - [x] `terminal_parser` — raw with 5ms flush timeout, taps data to ring buffer (PSRAM 32KB / internal 4KB)
  - [x] WebSocket `/ws/terminal` with history replay on connect
  - [x] Web UI: collapsible terminal window, save/copy/clear buttons, fullscreen mode
  - [x] ANSI rendering via xterm.js + fit addon (dynamic toggle, lazy load)
  - [x] Web input: keyboard toggle button → xterm onData → WebSocket → UART TX
  - [ ] Phase 3: dynamic UDP connect button near terminal window (non-persistent, applies on the fly)
  - [ ] Phase 4: configurable pattern matching → status badges (e.g. `login:` → Ready)

#### Network Improvements

- [ ] **DNS hostname support in UDP target**
  - Currently only IP address accepted, add `WiFi.hostByName()` resolve
  - Cache resolved IP with TTL to avoid per-packet DNS lookup

#### Advanced Protocol Management

- [ ] **Protocol Conversion Features**

  - [ ] **SBUS↔UART Bridge (ESP↔ESP transport)**

    **Use case**: Two ESP devices create a wired/wireless bridge for SBUS transport
    ```
    [SBUS Receiver] → ESP1 (SBUS IN → UART/UDP OUT) ~~~~ ESP2 (UART/UDP IN → SBUS OUT) → [FC]
    ```

    **UDP path — already implemented:**
    - ESP1: D1_SBUS_IN → D4_SBUS_UDP_TX (binary 25 bytes over UDP)
    - ESP2: D4_SBUS_UDP_RX → D3_SBUS_OUT (binary 25 bytes to FC)

    **UART path — implementation needed:**

    - [ ] **Output side (SBUS → UART)** — 80% ready
      - Infrastructure exists: UART 115200 8N1 init (from sbusTextFormat)
      - Need: "Raw binary" mode — passthrough 25 bytes without text conversion
      - Change: Add `sbusRawFormat` flag or modify sbusTextFormat logic
      - In sendDirect(): if raw mode, skip sbusFrameToText(), send binary directly

    - [ ] **Input side (UART → SBUS)** — needs new code
      - Need: Parse SBUS frames from standard UART stream (115200 8N1)
      - Reuse: `SbusParser` already exists for frame detection
      - New role: D2_UART_SBUS_IN or D3_UART_SBUS_IN
      - Flow: UART RX → SbusParser → validate → SbusRouter::feedFrame()
      - Challenge: No inter-frame gaps on standard UART, rely on 0x0F/0x00 markers

    **Implementation steps:**
    1. Add raw binary output mode (skip text conversion, keep 115200 8N1)
    2. Create new roles: D2_UART_SBUS_IN, D3_UART_SBUS_IN
    3. Connect SbusParser to UART input stream
    4. Register parsed frames with SbusRouter as new source
    5. Add web UI options for UART-SBUS bridge configuration

    **Existing code to reuse:**
    - `SbusParser` (protocols/sbus_parser.h) — frame detection
    - `SbusRouter` — source registration and routing
    - `initDevice*SBUS()` — UART configuration with 115200 mode
    - `sendDirect()` — output path in senders

    **ESP as hardware converter replacement:**
    ```
    Scenario A: ESP replaces SBUS→UART converter
    [SBUS Receiver] → ESP (SBUS IN 100000 8E2 INV) → UART OUT (115200 8N1) → [device]
    Role: D1_SBUS_IN + D2_UART_SBUS_OUT (raw binary, no text conversion)

    Scenario B: ESP replaces UART→SBUS converter
    [device] → UART (115200 8N1) → ESP (UART_SBUS_IN) → SBUS OUT (100000 8E2 INV) → [FC]
    Role: D2_UART_SBUS_IN + D3_SBUS_OUT

    Scenario C: ESP paired with external hardware converter
    [SBUS Receiver] → [HW SBUS→UART] → ESP (UART IN 115200) → SBUS OUT (100000 8E2) → [FC]

    Scenario D: Full ESP↔ESP wireless bridge
    [SBUS RX] → ESP1 (SBUS IN → UDP TX) ~~~WiFi~~~ ESP2 (UDP RX → SBUS OUT) → [FC]

    Scenario E: ESP↔ESP wired bridge (long cable)
    [SBUS RX] → ESP1 (SBUS IN → UART OUT 115200) ~~~wire~~~ ESP2 (UART IN → SBUS OUT) → [FC]
    ```
    - ESP can fully replace both SBUS→UART and UART→SBUS hardware converters
    - Compatible with existing hardware converters (direct wiring)
    - socat and ser2net for network transport
    - Any device that can send/receive 25-byte SBUS frames over standard UART

  - [ ] Configurable send rate for binary SBUS output (D2_SBUS_OUT, D3_SBUS_OUT, D4_SBUS_UDP_TX binary)
    - Currently binary SBUS outputs at native 70 Hz (14ms frame timing)
    - Some FC or receivers may benefit from throttled rate (50 Hz typical)
    - D4 binary (format=0) also needs rate control — currently only text format (format=1) has it
    - Reuse existing rate selector UI (10-70 Hz)

### Pre-release Testing

- [ ] **MAVLink RC Monitor** — test RC channel bars with real MAVLink traffic (msg 65 RC_CHANNELS, msg 70 RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE)
- [ ] **Terminal protocol** — test WebSocket terminal with UART device (e.g. RPi console)

### Future Considerations (Low Priority)

#### Platform Testing (waiting for hardware)

**Super Mini** — implemented, basic tested (WiFi, web, LEDs, UDP). Needs: UART devices, SBUS inverter, BLE testing.

**XIAO ESP32-S3** — implemented, basic tested (D1 UART + D2 USB with FC/MP). Needs: D3, RTS/CTS, SBUS, external antenna range, BLE testing.

- [ ] **Test CRSF input from TX16S JR bay** — ESP in TX module case, D1_CRSF_IN reads channels from radio, text output via BLE/UDP. Radio sends CRSF regardless of receiver link status.

#### BLE Remaining Tasks

  - [ ] **LOW**: Check encryption before sending notifications (`desc.sec_state.encrypted`)

  **Reference**: BLE GATT SBUS (NUS + Just Works pairing + bond persistence + WiFi coexistence) — implemented.
  Heap: S3 ~60KB free (min ~38KB), MiniKit ~42KB free (min ~16KB). WiFi + BLE + UDP + WebServer work simultaneously.

#### MP Plugin Improvements

  - [ ] **MEDIUM**: MAVLink telemetry via BLE NUS (MP plugin)

    **Use case**: ESP connected to drone via UART (MAVLink), sends telemetry via BLE to laptop.
    Laptop keeps WiFi for internet (maps, remote access), BLE works in parallel.
    Alternative: DroneBridge and similar use external BLE→vCOM bridge — plugin is cleaner.
    ```
    [Drone] →UART→ [ESP32-S3 BLE] →BLE NUS→ [Laptop: MP plugin]
                                               ↕ WiFi (internet, maps)
    ```

    **Approach**: WinRT `ICommsSerial` in plugin, integration into standard MP dropdown

    **MP API (verified, public, accessible from plugin):**
    - `MissionPlanner.Comms.SerialPort.GetCustomPorts` — `public static Func<List<string>>`
      - Plugin adds BLE devices to port list (appear as "BLE_ESP-Bridge_XXXX")
    - `Host.MainForm.CustomPortList` — `public Dictionary<Regex, Func<string, string, ICommsSerial>>`
      - Plugin registers factory: regex `BLE_.*` → creates `BleNusSerial`
    - User selects BLE port in standard dropdown, clicks Connect — MP works as usual

    **Implementation:**
    - [ ] Class `BleNusSerial : Stream, ICommsSerial` (~200-300 lines)
      - WinRT BLE API (Windows.Devices.Bluetooth) — no external DLLs
      - MemoryStream buffer for incoming data (notification callback)
      - Read() with timeout (deadline pattern, like CommsBLE/UdpSerial)
      - Write() via NUS RX characteristic
      - Open()/Close() — BLE connect/disconnect
      - Thread-safe buffer (lock, notification callback vs MP read thread)
    - [ ] Registration in Init(): GetCustomPorts += GetBleNusPorts, CustomPortList.Add(...)
    - [ ] Device discovery: reuse GetPairedNusDevicesAsync() from current plugin
    - [ ] Handle disconnect (IsOpen=false, exception from Read)

    **Throughput:** BLE NUS MTU 256 → ~15-20 KB/s. MAVLink 57600 baud ≈ 5.7 KB/s — 3x headroom.

    **ESP side:** no changes needed — BLE NUS already implemented, MAVLink data transparent for NUS.

    **Reference**: MP has experimental CommsBLE (since 2020, SimpleBLE, not in releases, BUSL-1.1 license).
    Our approach — WinRT, no license restrictions, no external DLLs.
    MP API: MainV2.cs:522 (CustomPortList), CommsSerialPort.cs:312 (GetCustomPorts).

  - [ ] **LOW**: Auto-reset ESP from bootloader mode (if manual RST checkbox isn't enough)
    - When COM connected but no data for >3s, try RTS toggle (up to 3 attempts with 3s intervals)
    - Reset attempt counter on first valid data line
    - Only when RST checkbox is enabled
    - Complements existing manual RST-on-connect feature (v2.2.5+)

#### UART Improvements 🔵 LOW PRIORITY

- [ ] **Hardware Flow Control CTS/RTS detection**
  - Currently: if flow control enabled in config but CTS/RTS not physically connected, TX blocks waiting for CTS signal
  - Other devices often auto-detect and fall back to no flow control
  - Idea: check CTS pin state before enabling hardware flow control
    - Configure CTS as input with pull-up
    - If CTS stays HIGH (pull-up wins) → likely not connected → disable flow control
    - If CTS is LOW → assume device connected and holding CTS
  - Not 100% reliable (CTS LOW could mean "not connected but grounded" or "connected, wait")
  - Low priority: UI checkbox now works correctly, users can disable manually

#### Memory Optimization (MiniKit) 🔵 LOW PRIORITY

  Current situation: ~35KB free heap with WiFi+BT+WebServer enabled

  - [ ] **Scenario A: WiFi only (D5_NONE)**
    - Release BT memory: `esp_bt_controller_mem_release(ESP_BT_MODE_CLASSIC_BT)` — frees ~30KB
    - Expected heap: ~65KB — sufficient for stable WiFi+UDP+WebServer
    - Use case: network telemetry without Bluetooth

  - [ ] **Scenario B: BT only (no network)**
    - Release WiFi memory: `esp_wifi_deinit()` + release — frees ~40KB
    - Expected heap: ~75KB — sufficient for stable BT operation
    - Use case: standalone BT serial adapter (SBUS text to phone)
    - WebServer only on quick reset for configuration

  - [ ] **Scenario C: Headless WiFi+UDP+BT**
    - Disable AsyncWebServer in normal operation — saves ~15-30KB runtime heap
    - Keep WiFi for UDP bridge, enable BT simultaneously
    - Expected heap: ~50-65KB
    - WebServer only on quick reset (for configuration)
    - mDNS still needed for quick reset discovery
    - Use case: full bridge functionality (UART↔UDP + UART↔BT)

  Implementation notes:
  - Memory release is one-way (cannot re-enable without reboot) — fits "save = reboot" model
  - Prefer runtime selection based on config (D5 role, D4 role) — avoid separate builds
  - Separate build configs only as last resort
  - Map file analysis: ESPAsyncWebServer ~109KB flash, web_api+web_interface ~97KB flash (static RAM minimal ~65 bytes)

  **Heap reference (MiniKit v2.18.12):**
  - WiFi+BT+WebServer: ~35KB free (BT stack takes ~40KB static)
  - BT only (no WiFi): ~70KB free
  - WiFi only (no BT in sdkconfig): ~76KB free

#### New Protocol Support 🔵 LOW PRIORITY

- [~] **CRSF Protocol** - RC channels and telemetry for ELRS/Crossfire systems
  - Phase 1-3: ✅ DONE (text/binary/bidirectional outputs via USB, UART3, UDP, BLE)
  - [ ] Test bidirectional CRSF with flight controller (Phase 3, telemetry back to ELRS RX)
  - [ ] Per-device filter UI (Phase 4, backend ready — UI currently sets all devices at once)
  - [ ] Telemetry extraction (Phase 4): structured data for web UI (battery, GPS, attitude)
  - [ ] VTX control via MSP-over-CRSF (Phase 5, requires bidirectional wiring)
  - Alternative: direct VTX protocols (SmartAudio by TBS, IRC Tramp by ImmersionRC) — low priority
  - **Reference**: [ExpressLRS crsf_protocol.h](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/lib/CrsfProtocol/crsf_protocol.h), [CRSF wiki](https://github.com/crsf-wg/crsf/wiki), [TBS spec](https://github.com/tbs-fpv/tbs-crsf-spec)
- [ ] **MSP Protocol** (Betaflight/iNav) 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
  - MSPv1 (`$M`) + MSPv2 (`$X`) frame parsing, CRC validation
  - Passive telemetry extraction from FC responses (no polling needed when GCS is connected)
  - Use cases beyond raw bridge:
    - RC Channel Monitor in web UI (MSP_RC msg 105, same as SBUS/CRSF/MAVLink)
    - Telemetry text output to USB/UDP/BLE (battery, GPS, attitude — like CRSF Text)
    - Arming state detection for LED indication
    - FC status in web UI (flight mode, CPU load, sensor flags)
    - VTX control (band/channel/power) — also available via MSP-over-CRSF (Phase 5)
  - Request-response protocol — FC doesn't push data, needs GCS polling or own polling timer
  - Implementation scope (MAVLink parity analysis):
    1. `MspParser` — MSPv1 + MSPv2 from scratch (two frame formats, two CRC algorithms)
    2. Protocol optimization mode — `MSP = 4` in enum, pipeline integration, web UI
    3. RC channels — MSP_RC (msg 105) → shared `RcChannelData`
    4. Statistics — valid/invalid frames, CRC errors, last activity in web UI
    5. No routing needed — MSP has no addressing (unlike MAVLink sysid/compid)
    6. Text telemetry output — optional, lower priority
  - Reference: [Betaflight MSP](https://betaflight.com/docs/development/API/MSP), [iNav MSP](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/MSP-V2)

#### System Reliability & Memory Management 🔵 LOW PRIORITY

- [ ] **Periodic Reboot System**
  - Configurable interval (12h, 24h, 48h, never)
  - Graceful shutdown with connection cleanup
  - Pre-reboot statistics logging

- [ ] **Emergency Memory Protection**
  - Critical threshold: 20KB (reboot after sustained low memory)
  - Warning threshold: 50KB (log warnings)
  - Heap fragmentation tracking

## Known Issues & Warnings

⚠️ **pioarduino pinned to 3.3.5 (ESP-IDF 5.5.1)** — DO NOT upgrade until BLE fix confirmed
- pioarduino 3.3.6+ (ESP-IDF 5.5.2) breaks BLE on MiniKit (ESP32 WROOM)
- Symptom: BLE pairing succeeds but NUS characteristics inaccessible, no data transfer
- ESP32-S3 boards not affected — only WROOM BTDM controller
- ESP-IDF 5.5.2 changelog suspects: BTDM scheduling priority changes, NimBLE handle duplication fix, HCI status fix
- When upgrading: uncomment `esp32-hal-bt-mem.h` include in bluetooth_ble.cpp (needed for 3.3.7+), delete cached sdkconfig files, test BLE on MiniKit before release
