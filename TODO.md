**Status**: XIAO ESP32-S3 support fully implemented and basic configuration tested (Device1 UART Bridge + Device2 USB working with flight controller and Mission Planner). Pin mapping verified: all GPIO pins are available on castellated edge holes. Web interface correctly displays D-pin names (D3/D4 for Device1, D8/D9 for Device2, D6/D7 for Device3). LED blink-only mode working. Need extended testing for Device3, RTS/CTS, network modes, and protocols.

**Note**: XIAO ESP32-S3 is even more compact than Super Mini. Has external antenna connector which is beneficial for network operations like SBUS over UDP/WiFi, improving range and reliability. This is important as boards like Zero with PCB antennas can have unstable ping times causing SBUS packet loss when timing requirements (14ms frame rate) are not met. External antenna should provide more stable connection for time-critical protocols.

#### ESP32 MiniKit Support ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ESP32 MiniKit (WROOM-32) fully implemented and tested. Features: WiFi, web interface, quick reset detection (3 resets = network mode), Bluetooth SPP bridge, SBUS support. Device 2 = USB via external chip (CP2104 tested). All protocols verified (MAVLink, SBUS binary/text).

**Note**: CH9102 may have DTR/RTS issues — not yet verified. WROOM-32 has limited RAM (~160KB heap) compared to S3 variants.

#### Memory Optimization (MiniKit) — Usage Scenarios

  Current situation: ~35KB free heap with WiFi+BT+WebServer enabled

  - [ ] **Scenario A: WiFi only (D5_NONE)**
    - Release BT memory: `esp_bt_controller_mem_release(ESP_BT_MODE_CLASSIC_BT)` — frees ~30KB
    - Expected heap: ~65KB — sufficient for stable WiFi+UDP+WebServer
    - Use case: network telemetry without Bluetooth

  - [ ] **Scenario B: BT only (no network)**
    - Release WiFi memory: `esp_wifi_deinit()` + release — frees ~40KB
    - Expected heap: ~75KB — sufficient for stable BT operation
    - Use case: standalone BT serial adapter (SBUS text to phone)
    - WebServer only on quick reset for configuration

  - [ ] **Scenario C: Headless WiFi+UDP+BT**
    - Disable AsyncWebServer in normal operation — saves ~15-30KB runtime heap
    - Keep WiFi for UDP bridge, enable BT simultaneously
    - Expected heap: ~50-65KB
    - WebServer only on quick reset (for configuration)
    - mDNS still needed for quick reset discovery
    - Use case: full bridge functionality (UART↔UDP + UART↔BT)

  Implementation notes:
  - Memory release is one-way (cannot re-enable without reboot) — fits "save = reboot" model
  - Prefer runtime selection based on config (D5 role, D4 role) — avoid separate builds
  - Separate build configs only as last resort
  - Map file analysis: ESPAsyncWebServer ~109KB flash, web_api+web_interface ~97KB flash (static RAM minimal ~65 bytes)

  **Heap reference (MiniKit v2.18.12):**
  - WiFi+BT+WebServer: ~35KB free (BT stack takes ~40KB static)
  - BT only (no WiFi): ~70KB free
  - WiFi only (no BT in sdkconfig): ~76KB free

### FUTURE PROTOCOLS & FEATURES 🔵

#### UART Improvements

- [ ] **Hardware Flow Control CTS/RTS detection**
  - Currently: if flow control enabled in config but CTS/RTS not physically connected, TX blocks waiting for CTS signal
  - Other devices often auto-detect and fall back to no flow control
  - Idea: check CTS pin state before enabling hardware flow control
    - Configure CTS as input with pull-up
    - If CTS stays HIGH (pull-up wins) → likely not connected → disable flow control
    - If CTS is LOW → assume device connected and holding CTS
  - Not 100% reliable (CTS LOW could mean "not connected but grounded" or "connected, wait")
  - Low priority: UI checkbox now works correctly, users can disable manually

#### Web Interface Improvements

- [ ] **Show connected clients info in AP mode**
  - Number of connected stations
  - List of client IP addresses
  - IP of current web interface user

- [x] **Web UI Refactoring with Alpine.js** ✅ COMPLETED

  **Completed migration**:
  - Alpine.js + Collapse + Persist plugins integrated
  - All device configuration logic moved to Alpine stores
  - Status updates, SBUS controls, protocol stats via reactive stores
  - help.html migrated to Alpine (collapsible sections with $persist)
  - Removed: device-config.js, status-updates.js (dead code cleanup)

  **Results achieved**:
  | Metric | Before | After |
  |--------|--------|-------|
  | JS files | 6 files | 4 files (app.js, utils.js, form-utils.js, crash-log.js) |
  | getElementById | 97 calls | ~15 calls (legacy crash-log, form-utils) |
  | x-model bindings | 0 | 44 |
  | $store references | 0 | 201 |

  **Follow-up tasks**:
  1. ~~**Split API endpoints**~~ ✅ DONE — `/api/config` + `/api/status` implemented
  2. ~~**JSON body for POST**~~ ✅ DONE — switched to JSON body, `handleSaveJson()` (~560 → ~486 lines)
     - JS sends JSON via `Content-Type: application/json`
     - C++ uses ArduinoJson for parsing (cleaner than manual string parsing)
     - Fixed log level selects disabled state (UART/Network logs react to device roles)

  **Status**: Alpine.js refactoring complete, all follow-up tasks done

#### Advanced Protocol Management

- [ ] **Protocol Conversion Features**

  - [ ] **SBUS↔UART Bridge (ESP↔ESP transport)**

    **Use case**: Two ESP devices create a wired/wireless bridge for SBUS transport
    ```
    [SBUS Receiver] → ESP1 (SBUS IN → UART/UDP OUT) ~~~~ ESP2 (UART/UDP IN → SBUS OUT) → [FC]
    ```

    **UDP path — already implemented:**
    - ESP1: D1_SBUS_IN → D4_SBUS_UDP_TX (binary 25 bytes over UDP)
    - ESP2: D4_SBUS_UDP_RX → D3_SBUS_OUT (binary 25 bytes to FC)

    **UART path — implementation needed:**

    - [ ] **Output side (SBUS → UART)** — 80% ready
      - Infrastructure exists: UART 115200 8N1 init (from sbusTextFormat)
      - Need: "Raw binary" mode — passthrough 25 bytes without text conversion
      - Change: Add `sbusRawFormat` flag or modify sbusTextFormat logic
      - In sendDirect(): if raw mode, skip sbusFrameToText(), send binary directly

    - [ ] **Input side (UART → SBUS)** — needs new code
      - Need: Parse SBUS frames from standard UART stream (115200 8N1)
      - Reuse: `SbusParser` already exists for frame detection
      - New role: D2_UART_SBUS_IN or D3_UART_SBUS_IN
      - Flow: UART RX → SbusParser → validate → SbusRouter::feedFrame()
      - Challenge: No inter-frame gaps on standard UART, rely on 0x0F/0x00 markers

    **Implementation steps:**
    1. Add raw binary output mode (skip text conversion, keep 115200 8N1)
    2. Create new roles: D2_UART_SBUS_IN, D3_UART_SBUS_IN
    3. Connect SbusParser to UART input stream
    4. Register parsed frames with SbusRouter as new source
    5. Add web UI options for UART-SBUS bridge configuration

    **Existing code to reuse:**
    - `SbusParser` (protocols/sbus_parser.h) — frame detection
    - `SbusRouter` — source registration and routing
    - `initDevice*SBUS()` — UART configuration with 115200 mode
    - `sendDirect()` — output path in senders

    **ESP as hardware converter replacement:**
    ```
    Scenario A: ESP replaces SBUS→UART converter
    [SBUS Receiver] → ESP (SBUS IN 100000 8E2 INV) → UART OUT (115200 8N1) → [device]
    Role: D1_SBUS_IN + D2_UART_SBUS_OUT (raw binary, no text conversion)

    Scenario B: ESP replaces UART→SBUS converter
    [device] → UART (115200 8N1) → ESP (UART_SBUS_IN) → SBUS OUT (100000 8E2 INV) → [FC]
    Role: D2_UART_SBUS_IN + D3_SBUS_OUT

    Scenario C: ESP paired with external hardware converter
    [SBUS Receiver] → [HW SBUS→UART] → ESP (UART IN 115200) → SBUS OUT (100000 8E2) → [FC]

    Scenario D: Full ESP↔ESP wireless bridge
    [SBUS RX] → ESP1 (SBUS IN → UDP TX) ~~~WiFi~~~ ESP2 (UDP RX → SBUS OUT) → [FC]

    Scenario E: ESP↔ESP wired bridge (long cable)
    [SBUS RX] → ESP1 (SBUS IN → UART OUT 115200) ~~~wire~~~ ESP2 (UART IN → SBUS OUT) → [FC]
    ```
    - ESP can fully replace both SBUS→UART and UART→SBUS hardware converters
    - Compatible with existing hardware converters (direct wiring)
    - socat and ser2net for network transport
    - Any device that can send/receive 25-byte SBUS frames over standard UART

  - [x] SBUS over WiFi/UDP with frame filtering and validation (implemented)
  - [x] Configurable UDP source timeout for Timing Keeper (100-5000ms, default 1000ms) ✅ v2.18.12
  - [x] Configurable UDP send rate (10-70 Hz, default 50 Hz) for SBUS Output over WiFi ✅ v2.18.12
  - [ ] Configurable send rate for binary SBUS output (D2_SBUS_OUT, D3_SBUS_OUT, D4_SBUS_UDP_TX binary)
    - Currently binary SBUS outputs at native 70 Hz (14ms frame timing)
    - Some FC or receivers may benefit from throttled rate (50 Hz typical)
    - D4 binary (format=0) also needs rate control — currently only text format (format=1) has it
    - Reuse existing rate selector UI (10-70 Hz)

### Future Considerations (Low Priority)

#### BLE SBUS for ESP32-S3 🔵 FUTURE

- [ ] **BLE GATT SBUS Output (ESP32-S3 only)**

  **Why**: ESP32-S3 has BLE but no Bluetooth Classic. BLE enables wireless SBUS to GCS with custom plugins.

  **Use case**: SBUS from RC receiver to Mission Planner/QGC via BLE
  ```
  [SBUS RX] → [ESP32-S3] → BLE GATT notify → [MP/QGC Plugin]
  ```

  **Advantages over WiFi:**
  - Phone/PC keeps WiFi for internet
  - Lower latency than Classic SPP (7.5-30ms vs 20-100ms)
  - Works on all S3 boards (Zero, SuperMini, XIAO)

  **Technical details:**
  - NimBLE stack (~20-30KB static RAM, lighter than Bluedroid)
  - GATT Server with SBUS characteristic
  - Notifications (ESP → Client), no pairing required for unencrypted data
  - SBUS frame (25 bytes) fits in single BLE packet (MTU ≥ 25)
  - Throughput ~20KB/s — sufficient for SBUS (70Hz × 25 bytes = 1.75KB/s)

  **Implementation (ESP side):**
  - [ ] Add NimBLE to sdkconfig for S3 boards
  - [ ] BluetoothBLE class (bluetooth/bluetooth_ble.h/.cpp)
  - [ ] SBUS GATT service and characteristic
  - [ ] Integration with protocol pipeline (SENDER_BLE)
  - [ ] D5_BLE_SBUS role for S3 boards

  **Implementation (GCS side):**
  - [ ] MP Plugin: BLE transport using Windows.Devices.Bluetooth API
  - [ ] Device discovery and connection UI
  - [ ] GATT characteristic subscription for SBUS data
  - [ ] Parse SBUS/Text format → RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE

  **Memory considerations:**
  - S3 boards: ~70-76KB free → with NimBLE ~45-55KB free
  - May require Scenario C (no WebServer in runtime) for stability
  - Alternative: separate builds with/without BLE (`zero_ble_production`)

  **Note**: Requires custom GCS plugin — no virtual COM port like Classic SPP.
  Plugin already needed for RC Override, adding BLE transport is incremental work.

#### New Protocol Support 🔵 LOW PRIORITY

- [ ] **CRSF Protocol** - RC channels and telemetry for ELRS/Crossfire systems
  - RC channel monitoring for automated switching (video frequencies, ELRS bands)
  - Telemetry data extraction (RSSI, link quality, GPS, voltage, current)
  - Integration with VTX control (SmartAudio/IRC Tramp)
- [ ] **Modbus RTU** - Inter-frame timing preservation
- [ ] **NMEA GPS** - GPS data parsing and routing
- [ ] **Per-device protocol configuration** - Independent protocol selection for each Device
- [ ] **Independent protocol detectors** - Separate MAVLink/SBUS/Raw detection per interface

#### System Reliability & Memory Management 🔵 LOW PRIORITY

- [ ] **Periodic Reboot System**
  - Configurable interval (12h, 24h, 48h, never)
  - Graceful shutdown with connection cleanup
  - Pre-reboot statistics logging

- [ ] **Emergency Memory Protection**
  - Critical threshold: 20KB (reboot after sustained low memory)
  - Warning threshold: 50KB (log warnings)
  - Heap fragmentation tracking
