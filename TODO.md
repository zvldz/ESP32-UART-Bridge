### PLATFORM SUPPORT - Before Final Cleanup üü†

- [x] **Hardware Adaptation**
  - [x] Pin mapping for S3 Super Mini board
  - [x] Adjust for different GPIO availability
  - [x] LED functionality verified (GPIO48 WS2815)
  - [ ] Verify USB-CDC functionality

- [x] **Build Configuration**
  - [x] Add platformio environment for S3 Super Mini
  - [x] Conditional compilation with board flags
  - [x] Web interface board type detection

- [ ] **Testing on S3 Super Mini** üü° BASIC TESTING COMPLETED
  - [x] Basic ESP32 operation verified
  - [x] WiFi and web interface working
  - [x] LED control functional
  - [x] UDP logging operational
  - [ ] Verify all UART interfaces work (Device 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Test SBUS with hardware inverter (critical for RC)
  - [ ] Check power consumption
  - [ ] Full protocol testing (MAVLink, SBUS, etc.)

**Status**: Super Mini support implemented but not fully tested. Basic functionality (WiFi, web, LEDs, UDP logs) confirmed working. UART and SBUS functionality requires hardware testing with actual devices.

#### XIAO ESP32-S3 Support üü° PLANNED

- [ ] **Hardware Adaptation**
  - [ ] Pin mapping for XIAO ESP32-S3 board
  - [ ] Adjust for different GPIO availability
  - [ ] LED functionality (single color LED, blink-only mode)
  - [ ] External antenna support configuration
  - [ ] Verify USB-CDC functionality
  - [ ] Consider compact form factor constraints

- [ ] **Build Configuration**
  - [ ] Add platformio environment for XIAO ESP32-S3
  - [ ] Conditional compilation with board flags
  - [ ] Web interface board type detection
  - [ ] SDK configuration for XIAO variant

- [ ] **Testing on XIAO ESP32-S3**
  - [ ] Basic ESP32 operation verification
  - [ ] WiFi and web interface functionality
  - [ ] LED control (blink patterns only, no RGB)
  - [ ] External antenna range/stability testing
  - [ ] UDP logging operational
  - [ ] Verify all UART interfaces work (Device 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Test SBUS with hardware inverter
  - [ ] Test SBUS over WiFi/UDP with external antenna
  - [ ] Check power consumption (important for small board)
  - [ ] Full protocol testing (MAVLink, SBUS, etc.)
  - [ ] Thermal testing (compact board heat dissipation)

**Note**: XIAO ESP32-S3 is even more compact than Super Mini. Has external antenna connector which is beneficial for network operations like SBUS over UDP/WiFi, improving range and reliability. This is important as boards like Zero with PCB antennas can have unstable ping times causing SBUS packet loss when timing requirements (14ms frame rate) are not met. External antenna should provide more stable connection for time-critical protocols. Need to verify pin availability and power/thermal characteristics for reliable operation.

### FUTURE ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS üîµ

#### MultiSource Pattern Generalization üü° FUTURE CONSIDERATION

Current `SbusMultiSource` implementation demonstrates a useful pattern that could be generalized for other protocols when needed:

- [ ] **Create Generic MultiSource Framework**
  - [ ] Extract common logic into template base class:
    ```cpp
    template<typename ChannelDataType>
    class MultiSourceManager {
        // Common source switching logic
        // Quality metrics calculation
        // Failover/failsafe handling
        // Configuration management
    };
    ```
  - [ ] Alternative interface-based approach:
    ```cpp
    class IMultiSource {
        virtual bool getActiveData(void* data) = 0;
        virtual void updateSource(SourceType src, void* data) = 0;
        virtual uint8_t getQuality(SourceType src) = 0;
    };
    ```

- [ ] **Protocol Specializations**
  - [ ] `SbusMultiSource` - current SBUS implementation (already done)
  - [ ] `MavlinkMultiSource` - for MAVLink command source switching (USB/UART/UDP)
  - [ ] `TelemetryMultiSource` - for telemetry data aggregation
  - [ ] `LogMultiSource` - for log source prioritization

- [ ] **Benefits of Generalization**
  - Consistent UI patterns across protocols
  - Reusable source quality metrics
  - Unified failover behavior
  - Reduced code duplication

**Note**: This is future work - don't implement until a second use case emerges. Current SBUS-specific implementation is sufficient and avoids over-engineering. Refactoring to generic pattern will be straightforward when needed.
